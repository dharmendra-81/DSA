A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `days` days.

The `ith` package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `days` days.

class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to calculate how many days are needed with a given capacity
    int findDays(vector<int>& weights, int cap) {
        int days = 1, load = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            if (load + weight > cap) {
                // Start a new day
                days++;
                load = weight;
            } else {
                load += weight;
            }
        }
        return days;
    }

    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
        // Minimum possible capacity is the max weight (can't split a package)
        int low = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        // Maximum possible capacity is the sum of all weights (ship everything in one day)
        int high = accumulate(weights.begin(), weights.end(), 0);

        // Binary search for the minimal feasible capacity
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            int requiredDays = findDays(weights, mid);

            if (requiredDays <= days) {
                // Try smaller capacity
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                // Need more capacity
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;  // This is the minimum capacity to ship within 'days'
