Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low=0, high=nums.size()-1;
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        while(low<=high){
            if(nums[low]<=nums[high]){ // already sorted
                ans=min(ans, nums[low]);
                break;
            }
            int mid=(low+high)/2;
            if(nums[mid]>=nums[low]){ // left part is sorted
                ans=min(ans, nums[low]);
                low=mid+1;
            }
            else{ // right part is sorted
                high=mid-1;
                ans=min(ans, nums[mid]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
