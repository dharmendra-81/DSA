Given two strings `s` and `t`, _determine if they are isomorphic_.
Two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

```cpp
bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        int m1[256], m2[256];
        //256 covers all possible ASCII characters
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
            if(m1[s[i]] != m2[t[i]])
                return false;
            m1[s[i]] = i+1;
            m2[t[i]] = i+1;
        }
        return true;
    }
```
O(N)
