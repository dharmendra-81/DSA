You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.
You should return the array of nums such that the the array follows the given conditions:
1. Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs**.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in `nums` is **preserved**.
3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return _the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions_.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> ans(nums.size(),0); // Initializes 'ans' with every element as zero
        int pos = 0, neg = 1;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if(nums[i] > 0) {
                ans[pos] = nums[i];
                pos += 2;
            } else {
                ans[neg] = nums[i];
                neg += 2;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
